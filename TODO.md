# AsciigenPy TODO

## Evening UI Updates (Completed)
- [x] Move action buttons like "Import Image" (open file) and "Invert" at the top, in an horizontal bar format.
- [x] Add a button to open/close the image preview window, remembering the image that was already loaded (if any) with the cropped settings.
- [x] Make Output Width adaptable: add height slider and a toggle option to keep proportions/aspect ratio.


## Merge
- [x] Merge dev branch into main


## Future Development
- [x] Write a `ROADMAP.md` file for future development:
  - [x] Advanced project setup
  - [x] Decoupling & file splitting for development
  - [x] Cleaner code (SOLID, DRY, KISS)
  - [x] Keep a Changelog
  - Repository setup
  - Compilation tools for users (PyInstaller/AppImage construction)
  - Deep research of asciigen features to implement them (e.g. changing fonts and easy exporting options)
  - [x] Remember last opened folder even after the program closes, to ensure file opening consistency
